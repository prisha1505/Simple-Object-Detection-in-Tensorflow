# Simple-Object-Detection-in-Tensorflow
# How to use object detection models available in Tensorflow Hub. In the following sections,we will:
# explore the Tensorflow Hub for object detection models
# load the models in your workspace
# preprocess an image for inference
# run inference on the models and inspect the output
